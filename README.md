# Angular 18 showcase

This project's main aim is to use most of Angular v18 new features. For this, the main guidelines for the project writing are:

## Declarative Coding => Signals + RxJS + ngxtension
## Zoneless

### Signals for reactive synchronous stream of events
### RxJS for reactive asynchronous stream of events
### ngxtension as an utilities helper for both
